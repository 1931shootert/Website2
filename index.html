            This is my story of recieving my life saving double lung transplant on April 8 2023.My story begins by being missdiagnosed for several years due to a lack of specialists on North Vancouver Island.So my first message is if you are having any lung issues get a referal to a respirologist ASAP. I was finally fortunate enough to be referred to Dr. John Ried in Victoria and he immediantly informed me that he believed i would eventually need a lung transplant as I had a auto immune disorder called Sarcodosis that was attacking my lungs. So began the long process of getting listed for a possible lung transplant. The most pressing need was to get my Body Mass Index down to the allowable target weight. Before i would even get considered i needed to lose 100 lbs which in itself was very overwhelming. But with the support of family I put my head down and got to work.Slowly but surely all the while being on supplemental Oxygen 24/7 I did it. The sun was rapidly setting on the shooters life as I was finally officially listed on March 31 2023 with what my Drs figured was at the most weeks to live. Then I collapsed at Victoria Jubilee Hospital and was air lifted by chopper to Vancouver General to hopefully await a match. After one false match on April 10 my family was informed that it was a go and i was rushed into emergency transplant surgery.The first of many miracles happened that day as their was certainly no guarantee that a match could be found in time to save my life.
