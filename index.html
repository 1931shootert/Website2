            This is my story of recieving my life saving double lung transplant on April 8 2023.My story begins by being missdiagnosed for several years due to a lack of specialists on North Vancouver Island.So my first message is if you are having any lung issues get a referal to a respirologist ASAP. I was finally fortunate enough to be referred to Dr. John Ried in Victoria and he immediantly informed me that he believed i would eventually need a lung transplant as I had a auto immune disorder called Sarcodosis that was attacking my lungs. So began the long process of getting listed for a possible lung transplant. The most pressing need was to get my Body Mass Index down to the allowable target weight. Before i would even get considered i needed to lose 100 lbs which in itself was very overwhelming. But with the support of family I put my head down and got to work.Slowly but surely all the while being on supplemental Oxygen 24/7 I did it. The sun was rapidly setting on the shooters life as I was finally officially listed on March 31 2023 with what my Drs figured was at the most weeks to live. Then I collapsed at Victoria Jubilee Hospital and was air lifted by chopper to Vancouver General to hopefully await a match. After one false match on April 10 my family was informed that it was a go and i was rushed into emergency transplant surgery.The first of many miracles happened that day as their was certainly no guarantee that a match could be found in time to save my life.

            After surviving my transplant my real battle began. We lost count of how many times i got rushed back into surgery. I had a stroke, multipul seizures , blood poisoning , internal bleeding , and a violent fall where i tore my rotator cuff. I was on Dyalasis for Kidney failure and told I had 0% chance of regaining my kidney function and would need a kidney transplant next. I hope some people learned never to bet against the Shooter. After 6 months in the hospital and 2 moths at GF strong I walked out of their against all the odds on my own 2 feet breathing with my own lungs.

                With out all of the support i recieved from so many kind souls I would not have survived my journey. The fundraising was absolutely vital as what we found out is in order to even be put on the transplant list we needed to prove we had a support team willing to relocate to Vancouver for the duration of my stay which ended up being 6 long months. We also found out in a hurry it was not covered despite the FNHA having a mandate to provide support my requests were repeatly denied despite winning 2 seperate appeals through their own process. The total costs were approximately $45,000 we needed to fundraise. The list is too long to thank everyone but I want to give a special Gilakasla to my Murray family from the Nimmo Bay Resort who provided me with critical finacial and spiritual support. And of course my family and community who never blinked an eye and got busy doing the hard work. I truly believe in the beauty of the human spirit. My brother Kodi reminded me several times that their is NO QUIT IN OUR DNA.
